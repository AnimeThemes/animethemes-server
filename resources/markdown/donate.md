## Why does AnimeThemes need your help?

AnimeThemes is a hobby project run out of pocket by a team of volunteers. AnimeThemes requires the use of commercial infrastructure and incurs nontrivial bandwidth overages in order to serve video to the wider anime community. The site is free to use and does not run ads. While para, the site creator, has covered the costs at first, we will need your support to keep this service up going forward. 

Donations made to us will go to covering costs and allow us to keep running this site into the future and growing it out into something greater and greater!

## What do I get in return for donating?

Donators get the cosmetic reward of a Patron role in our [Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/m9zbVyQ). Patrons can also request registration invitations to our resource management console. As the project grows, rewards are subject to change as we build out features into the site.
