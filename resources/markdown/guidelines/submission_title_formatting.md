**Title Format**

    Anime Title (Season Year) - {OP|ED}x Vy - "Song Title" [Tag1][Tag2]...

**Title Components**

`Anime Title` - Derived from the header of the anime's MAL page. We also permit the use of common synonyms, abbreviations and licensed titles with the use of the delimiter "/".

`Season Year` - The Season and Year of the anime's initial release.

* This will correspond to the location of the title in the Year Index of the wiki.
* In the general case, this value can be derived from the "Premiered" field of the anime's MAL page.
* For Movies, OVAs, Specials, and shows that do not premiere at the beginning of the season, we will derive the premiere within the boundary of the Season's duration.

`{OP|ED}x Vy` - The sequence and variant number

* Openings should be marked as `OP`.
* Endings should be marked as `ED`.
* If the number of sequences is not known, especially for new premieres, the numbering `x` is not required.
* The variant number `Vy` is only required from the second version onward.
* In the general case, we will follow the numbering of sequences on the anime's MAL page. 

`Song Title` - The title of the music track

* In the general case, we will follow the anime's MAL page for deriving Song Titles.
* We recommend cross-referencing MAL with other resources such as Japanese Wikipedia and ANN's Encyclopedia to confirm the accuracy of Song Titles.
* If the title cannot be derived, we will allow the submission to use an empty value for this field.
* We permit the use of an parenthetical after the quoted Song Title to provide the original character set of the Song Title. This is useful in the absence of accepted translations on available resources.

`Tags` - Identifying characteristics of the video

* The first tag must identify the sequence as an opening or ending with `[OP]` or `[ED]` respectively.
* It is mandatory that the resolution of the video is tagged as `[{frame height}]`.
* Include as many tags as are applicable to the video.

| Tag  | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| [OP] | Opening theme |
| [ED] | Ending theme |
| [NC] | No credits |
| [720] | 720p video |
| [1080] | 1080p video |
| [Subbed] | Video includes subtitles of the dialogue |
| [Lyrics] | Video includes English lyrics subtitles |
| [Uncen] | The video is uncensored but was for the original broadcast or release |
| [Spoiler] | The video contains spoilers. You may also include up to which episode is spoiled, e.g. [Ep. 6 spoilers] |
| [NSFW] | The video contains risqué imagery and is not safe for work |
| [Trans] | The video contains part of the episode which transitions into the OP or ED |
| [Over] | The OP or ED song plays over the episode |
| [BD] | The video is from a Blu-ray Disc source |
| [DVD] | The video is from a DVD source |
| [VHS] | The video is from a VHS source |
| [VN] | The video is from a visual novel |
