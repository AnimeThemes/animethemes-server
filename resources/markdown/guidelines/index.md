## Maintain a balance between video quality and file size

We want to keep the file sizes of our videos low. This does not mean that the quality of submitted videos have to be low too. Try to balance this as well as you can. For a 90-second sequence, aim for a maximum file size of 60 MB, 45 MB, and 30 MB for 1080p, 720p, and 480p videos, respectively. Only if the video quality suffers too much should you use a higher file size.

## Meaningful Improvements

Reposts are accepted in the following conditions:

* Fixing incorrectly synced audio
* Fixing corrupted, damaged, and/or very low-bitrate (<64 kbps) audio
* Removing stray frames or stray noise
* Significant file size reduction
* Reducing visual artifacts and/or improving visual quality

## Coverage within Reason

We aim to represent as many shows as thoroughly as we can, but not at the cost of video quality or of the cleanliness of our repository. The moderation team reserves the right to curate titles, sequences, and variants.
